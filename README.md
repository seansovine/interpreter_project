# Writing an Interpreter

This is a project for learning about the parts of an interpreter,
and then maybe some parts of compilers. It is inspired by, and will
based -- at least in part -- on the book *Crafting an Interpreter*
by Robert Nystrom. But there are other good sources we'd like to follow
to.

Here are a few goals we have while starting out:

+ To understand enough to write our own parser, including lexing, etc.
+ To be able to dig into and understand the source code of CPython.
+ Same for the Zend (PHP) engine.
+ To be ready to contribute to these projects, and also to Typst.

So, we want to dip our toes into languages and compilers, starting with
parsers and their antecedents. Should be a fun journey!
