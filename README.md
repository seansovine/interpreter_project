# Writing an Interpreter

This is a project for learning about the parts of an interpreter,
and then maybe some parts of compilers. It is inspired by, and will be
based -- at least in part -- on the excellent book *Crafting an Interpreter*
by Robert Nystrom. We will follow and mention other good sources as
we go, too.

Here are a few goals we have while starting out:

+ To understand enough to write our own parser, including lexing, etc.
+ To be able to dig into and understand the source code of CPython.
+ Same for the Zend (PHP) engine.
+ To potentially contribute to these projects, and also to Typst.

So, we want to dip our toes into languages and compilers, starting with
parsers and their antecedents. It should be a fun journey!

Granted, these goals are ambitious and time is limited -- and we have
lots of other interests. So we may never get there for all of them. But,
hey, it's nice and motivating to have goals, and we're sure to learn from
any work we do on this.

## Progress

As mentioned above, we are following along with the book *Crafting an Interpreter*,
and we will start by implementing a Rust version of his parser from the book.
(Which several others have also done, a Google search reveals.)
So far we've implemented a basic version of the scanner,
[here](interpreter/src/parser/scanner.rs),
supporting single-character tokens, using the `FileUtf8Reader` described below.
We'll finish that up and move on to the parser soon.

Later we plan to make our own language with some of its own bells and
whistles, using Bob's Lox as a starting point. For that we will use our
implementation of his parser and modify it as needed,
including the scanner.

## Some code ideas

__Lazy file char iterator:__

The module [`src/parser/file_utf8_reader.rs`](interpreter/src/parser/file_utf8_reader.rs) has a
struct type `FileUtf8Reader` that implements the `Iterator` trait. It is a
wrapper around `BufReader<File>`, and its iterator only reads enough bytes
from the file to read the next utf-8 char. This is useful for reading utf-8
chars from large file, potentially containing no linebreaks, without reading
the entire file into memory first.
