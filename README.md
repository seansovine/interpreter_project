# Writing an Interpreter

This is a project for learning about the parts of an interpreter,
and then maybe some parts of compilers. It is inspired by, and will
based -- at least in part -- on the book *Crafting an Interpreter*
by Robert Nystrom. We will follow and mention other good sources as
we go, too.

Here are a few goals we have while starting out:

+ To understand enough to write our own parser, including lexing, etc.
+ To be able to dig into and understand the source code of CPython.
+ Same for the Zend (PHP) engine.
+ To be ready to contribute to these projects, and also to Typst.

So, we want to dip our toes into languages and compilers, starting with
parsers and their antecedents. It should be a fun journey!

Granted, these goals are ambitious and time is limited -- and we have lots
of other interests. So we may never get there, but, hey, I think it's
nice and motivating to have goals. We're sure to learn a lot from
any work we do on this.
